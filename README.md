I built this portfolio website to present my projects and experience in a structured and professional way. It features responsive design, clean UI components, and an organized layout to make navigation simple. The goal of this site is to show my practical work with React, JavaScript, and UI development, while also giving a quick introduction to who I am and what I’m learning as a developer.
